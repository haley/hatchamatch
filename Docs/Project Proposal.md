3.0 Project Proposal

## 3.0 Project Proposal

This document presents the proposal for the Hatch-a-Match Project. The project performs matching of bigs and littles in on campus organizations using a genetic algorithm.

### 3.0.1 Description

​	The Hatch-a-Match project provides a matching website for “Bigs” and “Littles” in organizations on college campuses across the world. Many Greek organizations and clubs use bigs and littles to match up incoming members and more experienced members in their organizations. The website uses a genetic algorithm to generate random matchings and find the best of those matchings and then breed those solutions and cull them down to better matchings. The organizer of the process will be able to input the names and preferences of their members and will receive a full matching. The process will automatically match two people if they both put each other as the top choice on their preferences list. 

​	In watching multiple organizations enter their big and little sorting processes, it is evident that there are many flaws in the processes. The most evident flaw is that many organizations are too large for one person to be able to effectively organize matches from a large number of people.In some cases, the person or people organizing the process can favor their friends and this leads to drama and complaining within the organization and takes what should be an exciting time into a place of harboring anger or upset.

​	One other similar software has been created, however it does not adapt for the ability to have a different number of bigs and littles, and lets every person in the matching process know who their match is. This software hopes to be more practical and customizable in terms of how many people in each side of the process. It will also only notify the organizer of the final list of matches in order to assure that any organized activities such as “Big-Little Reveal” will not be spoiled by the software itself.

### 3.0.2 Justification

​	This project will allow me to develop a fully functional web application which will expand my skills in front end development. It will also allow me to demonstrate my experience in developing optimal algorithms. This solves a problem that can potentially have an extremely large search space where finding the best possible match could take N! time. This decreases the amount of time spent searching but is still able to find a good match. I am proficient in Python, but will be learning a lot of new material about front end development which will allow me to grow my skills while still being able to finish in one semester. I created a proof of concept for this project last semester called “Big Little” in which I developed the basic ideas, but this semester I will be working on adding data structures to organize my work as well as adapting for a variable number of people in the matching process.
